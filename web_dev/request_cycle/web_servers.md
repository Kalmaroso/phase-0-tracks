#Design philosophies of the Linux OS
In contrast to the Windoes or Mac OS, Linux OS assumes that the user is computer savvy and knows what he or she is doing, and accordingly allows the Linux user to be in full control, sort of omnipotent, while the Mac and Windowws OS primarily uses graphical interfaces that only allow the user to do what the creator of the OS thinks the user should do. 

#VPS

A virtual private server is like a virtual computer running on someones computer memory somewhere else. It is walled off from the rest of it, has an OS system, but there is no other hardware there accpet for the memory to store data or run software. The benefits are, that it is very cheap, compared to an actual physical server, but can be have a weaker performance.
