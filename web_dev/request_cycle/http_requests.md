#difference between a GET and POST request
A GET request retrives Data from a certain host, while a POST request submits data to a host, where it is processed.

POST rquest can be used to edit and change the information at a host, while GET is used once the site is safe and any user can retrieve that information.

#cookies
cookies are small datatypes that save userinformation to alter and make requests different depending on the user information, like saving information from the first visit and changing the website slightly for the second visit by the same person. (For example the passwords that are saved so you dont have to retype it every time.)
