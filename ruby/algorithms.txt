 1. Determine current location of robot (what floor)

 2. Determine the destination ( floor number)

 3. determine wether the destination is up or down

 4. press the according button to call the lift ( up or down)

 5.  repeat every thirty seconds:

 		if lift arrives

 			step forward
 		otherwise 
 			press button again
     if lift doesnt appear after 10 loops
     	use stairs----> end of programm
 
 6. determine the amount of floors in the building

 7. determine how many rows and columns the list of floors has

 8. choose correct button accordingly

 9. ask the room: Does anyone need me to press another button

 10. if somone answers with a number 
 		press said number

 		if lift doesnt move

 			press doors close button

 	if repeated a 100 times
 		---> step out of the elevator and use stairs
 		end of programm

 12. Once lift is moving engage program "small talk about the weather"

13. when lift stops
		if current floor number is the wanted destination
			step out of lift
			---> end program

		elseif stay in the lift and repeat steps 11 and 13, continue on with step 12. 


Algorithm to determine wether to get out of bed in the morning:

repeat program every hour until out of bed

	1. wake up

	2. determine date

	3. determine time

	4. determine weekday

	3. if date overlaps with vacation or weekday overlaps with weekends
		
			if its earlier than noon 
				keep sleeping

			else 
				repeat program in an hour
			end

		else 
			if its earlier than 5am 
				keep sleeping and repeat program in an hour
			else 
				wake up 
			end
		end
