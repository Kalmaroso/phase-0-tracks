The standard JOIN we use joins the two tables with according to a certain condition. Here is the example: 

sqlite> SELECT foods.name, types.name FROM foods JOIN types ON foods.types_id = types.id;

Chicken breasts|Meat
Eggs|Dairy products
Ice cream|Desert
Bread|Starchy food
Apples|Fruits
Potatoes|Vegetable

A natural join is the same, but only works if we have the the same column names for the merging parts, which doesnt work for our tables.

CROSS JOINS compare every row of one table with every row of another table, this creates huge lists and can be dangerous.
Here is what happens when you use it on my tables:
 SELECT foods.name, types.name FROM foods CROSS JOIN types;

Chicken breasts|Vegetable
Chicken breasts|Fruits
Chicken breasts|Meat
Chicken breasts|Starchy food
Chicken breasts|Desert
Chicken breasts|Dairy products
Eggs|Vegetable
Eggs|Fruits
Eggs|Meat
Eggs|Starchy food
Eggs|Desert
Eggs|Dairy products
Ice cream|Vegetable
Ice cream|Fruits
Ice cream|Meat
Ice cream|Starchy food
Ice cream|Desert
Ice cream|Dairy products
Bread|Vegetable

Apples|Vegetable
